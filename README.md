# DEEP LEARNING PROJECTS

1. **HW1- Training Shallow Models :**
   This project contains implementation of a shallow neural network using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras to predict elbow acceleration from neural data. The project includes conducting and tracking a batch of experiments with SLURM and Weights and Biases, analyzing results across different conditions. The data set consists of neural and arm movement data, and model performance is evaluated using custom metrics.([HW1 description](https://symbiotic-computing.org/fagg_html/classes/aml_2024/hw/hw1.html))

  

2. **HW2 - Deep Network with Hyper-parameter Search:**
   The "HW2: Deep Network with Hyper-parameter Search" project focuses on developing deeper neural networks with various regularization techniques to assess performance on a given dataset. The project involves varying multiple hyper-parameters and using SLURM for batch experiments. Techniques explored include networks without regularization, with dropout, and with Lx regularization across different settings. Results are compiled to identify optimal configurations, and plots are generated to illustrate the performance impacts of these regularization methods under various experimental conditions.([HW2 description](https://symbiotic-computing.org/fagg_html/classes/aml_2024/hw/hw2.html))


  
3. **HW3 - Convolutional Neural Networks:**
   The "HW3: Convolutional Neural Networks" project focuses on developing two CNN models (shallow and deep) to classify objects from the Core50 dataset. Participants will test these models across five rotations to ensure consistent performance and use regularization and dropout to minimize over-fitting. The project deliverables include validation accuracy and loss learning curves, histograms of test set accuracy, confusion matrices, and a visual display of model predictions. The goal is to validate the effectiveness of the CNN models through comprehensive testing and analysis.([HW3 description](https://symbiotic-computing.org/fagg_html/classes/aml_2024/hw/hw3.html))

4. **HW4 - Semantic Labeling:**
   The "HW4: Semantic Labeling" project involves creating models for semantic labeling of satellite imagery from the Chesapeake Watershed dataset. This dataset features high-dimensional patches, each representing different environmental features like water, vegetation, and roads. Participants are tasked with designing two models: a shallow and a deep network, each tested across five dataset rotations to ensure performance consistency. Key project outputs include model architecture diagrams, validation accuracy over training epochs, confusion matrices for test sets, and visual comparisons of true versus predicted labels. The goal is to develop and compare the effectiveness of different network architectures in accurately classifying each pixel's environmental feature.([HW4 description](https://symbiotic-computing.org/fagg_html/classes/aml_2024/hw/hw4.html))

5. **HW5 - RNNs + CNNs:**
   The "HW5 - RNNs + CNNs" project tasks participants with classifying amino acid chains into protein families using RNN and CNN models. Using the Pfam database, the assignment compares two architectures across five data rotations to assess their predictive accuracy. Outputs include diagrams of network architectures, accuracy plots for training and validation, and comparisons of test accuracies between models. This exercise aims to determine the most effective neural network configuration for classifying complex biological sequences.([HW5 description](https://symbiotic-computing.org/fagg_html/classes/aml_2024/hw/hw5.html))

6. **HW6: Advanced RNNs and Attention:**
   The "HW6: Advanced RNNs and Attention" project involves classifying amino acid chains into 46 protein families using sophisticated neural architectures. This task utilizes two advanced models: a GRU network with convolutional pre-processing and a Multi-Headed Attention network with positional encoding. Both are designed to handle the increased sequence length and dataset size effectively. Key outputs include network architecture diagrams, training and validation accuracy plots, and scatter plots comparing the test accuracies and training durations of the models. The goal is to evaluate the performance and computational efficiency of each architecture across multiple rotations.([HW6 description](https://symbiotic-computing.org/fagg_html/classes/aml_2024/hw/hw6.html))
