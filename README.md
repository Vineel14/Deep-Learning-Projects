# DEEP LEARNING PROJECTS

1. **CS 5043 HW1- Training Shallow Models :**
   This project contains implementation of a shallow neural network using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras to predict elbow acceleration from neural data. The project includes conducting and tracking a batch of experiments with SLURM and Weights and Biases, analyzing results across different conditions. The data set consists of neural and arm movement data, and model performance is evaluated using custom metrics.
